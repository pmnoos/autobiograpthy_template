## üí° **Writing Tips**

### Getting Started
- **Start small**: Begin with one vivid memory or story
- **Don't aim for perfection**: First drafts are meant to be messy
- **Use your senses**: Describe what you saw, heard, smelled, felt
- **Include emotions**: How did events make you feel?
- **Be specific**: Details make stories come alive

### Overcoming Writer's Block
- **Talk it out**: Tell your story to someone else first
- **Use photos**: Let old pictures trigger memories
- **Ask family**: Get their perspectives on shared experiences
- **Write letters**: Address chapters to specific people
- **Start anywhere**: You don't have to write chronologically

### Making It Engaging
- **Show, don't tell**: Instead of "I was nervous," describe sweaty palms
- **Use dialogue**: Include conversations when you remember them
- **Add context**: Explain what was happening in the world at the time
- **Include others**: Let family and friends share their memories too
- **Be honest**: Authentic stories are more powerful than perfect ones
